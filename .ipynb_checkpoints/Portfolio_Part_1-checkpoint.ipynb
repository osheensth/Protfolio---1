    "We are provided with the Epinions data collected through a general consumer review web site Epinions.com. Each user on the site can rate and post a review for products (items) and other users would rate the review to show the helpfulness of the review.\n",
    "In this data, for each user, we have user ID, gender, ratings (1-5) and reviews towards the products they bought. For each rating, we have the product name and its category, the rating score, the time point when the rating is created, and the helpfulness (1-5) of this rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, there are several separate files to record the user-item rating info, user demographic info and item descriptive info, we have conducted preliminary processing to map and merge the data into one csv file named 'Epinions_test_data.csv'. The header of the csv file is shown below. \n",
